# Contributions

## Non-Government
Contributions to the baseline project from outside the US Federal Government
should be submitted as a pull request to the [upstream
project](https://github.com/simp) on GitHub.

By submitting a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
to this repository, you agree that you:

1. Own the contribution that you are providing or have obtained permission from
   the contribution owner

1. Allow your contribution to be licensed under the license of the target
   project

1. Allow your contribution to be freely distributed to the public

1. Allow the US Government [Unlimited Rights](#Unlimited-Rights) to your contribution

If you or your company wish your copyright in your contribution to be annotated
in the project documentation (such as this README), then your pull request
should include that annotation.
 
## Government
Contributions from Government agencies require verification that the government
has unlimited rights to the contribution.  An email to **TBD** is sufficient,
stating that the contribution was developed by an employee of the United States
Government in the course of his or her duties. Alternatively, if the
contribution was developed by a contractor, the email should provide the name
of the Contractor, Contract number, and an assertion that the contract included
the standard "Unlimited Rights" clause specified by [DFARS 252.227.7014](http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252227.htm#252.227-7014)
"Rights in noncommercial computer software and noncommercial computer software
documentation".
 
Government agencies are encouraged to submit contributions as pull requests on
GitHub.  If your agency cannot use GitHub, contributions can be emailed as
patches to **TBD**.
